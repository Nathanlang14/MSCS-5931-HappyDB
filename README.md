# (Potential) Research Questions
* **Exploratory Analysis:** How the dataset looks like, distribution of age-group, sex-group etc. **(Eyad is working on this)**
* **Predictions:** Can we predict someone's happiness predicted category from their text? **(Nate completed this part)**
* **Looking for reasons to be happy:** What specific topic makes the whole user-group or a sub-group happy? (qualitative approach) **(Adib is looking into these questions, and is writing analysis on these parts)**
